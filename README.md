# Mandelbrot-Set-Computation 

Mandelbrot Set computation in both sequential and parallel way (using **OpenMP** and **MPI**) with consequent speedup evaluation.

All the work has been done during the "*High Performance Computing*" course during my *MSc in Data Science and Engineering* at *Universit√† degli Studi di Genova*.
